  Responsiveness: The UI is designed to be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes.
  Accessibility: The app considers accessibility guidelines, making it inclusive to a broader audience.
  Localization: Proper localization is implemented to support multiple languages.
  Security: User data and sensitive information are handled securely following best practices.
  Testing: The app includes unit tests and widget tests to ensure reliability and functionality.
  Documentation: Code is documented with comments to make it more understandable for other developers.



                    Third-Party Libraries and Their Respective Purposes:
- cupertino_icons: Provides Cupertino (iOS-style) icons for the app's UI components.
- http: For making HTTP requests to APIs and handling server communication.
- intl: For localization and internationalization support.
- provider: A state management package that allows efficient and easy state management throughout the app.
- location: For handling device location and geocoding functionality.
- latlong2: For working with geographical coordinates and distance calculations.
- supercharged: A set of utility functions and extensions to make development faster and more productive.
- material_design_icons_flutter: Provides Material Design icons for the app's UI components.

                            How to Build the Project:
  Make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine.
  Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone <repository_url>
  Navigate to the project directory: cd <project_directory>
  Get the dependencies: flutter pub get
  Run the app on an emulator or a physical device: flutter run
                             Additional Notes:
  The app includes a sample implementation of a login screen with user authentication using Provider.
  The app's UI is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with smooth animations and transitions.
  A dark theme is provided as an option for users who prefer a darker color scheme.
  For large-scale applications, consider using other architectural patterns like BLoC or Redux for more structured state management.
  The project may include additional packages based on specific app requirements.
